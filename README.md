## Project Overview

This project showcases the application of advanced data acquisition techniques and sophisticated multiple linear regression analysis. Exploring the relationship between socioeconomic factors and California incarceration rates, we aim to identify significant predictors of incarceration rates and recommend policy approaches to mitigate rates within vulnerable communities. This project was completed in collaboration with Kefeng Xiao and Vidith Balasa.

## Abstract

Our study delves into how community demographics, including race, urban-rural categorizations, proportions of teenagers in communities, unemployment rates, poverty rates, population density, and education levels correlate with incarceration rates. Utilizing data from The Prison Policy Initiative and the United States Census Bureau, we crafted linear regression models to understand and predict the influence of these variables on incarceration rates across California's census tracts.

## Dataset

Data was sourced from The Prison Policy Initiative and combined with tract-level socioeconomic information from the 2020 United States Census Bureau. Initial data cleaning focused on preparing and merging these datasets for analysis.

## Methods

The project utilized multiple linear regression, with preliminary analysis to check assumptions-- addressing multicollinearity, influential points, heteroscedasticity, normality, and linearity. Different model selection techniques were employed to refine the regression model.
