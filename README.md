## Project Overview

This project showcases the application of advanced data acquisition techniques coupled with multiple linear regression analysis to explore the relationship between socioeconomic factors and California incarceration rates.

## Abstract

Our study delves into how community demographics, including racial demographics, urban-rural categorizations, proportions of teenagers in communities, unemployment rates, poverty rates, population density, and education levels correlate with incarceration rates. Utilizing data from The Prison Policy Initiative and the United States Census Bureau, we fit linear regression models to explore the influence of these variables on incarceration rates across California's census tracts.

## Dataset

Data was scraped from The Prison Policy Initiative's website and combined with tract-level socioeconomic information from the 2020 United States Census Bureau. Initial data cleaning focused on preparing and merging these datasets for analysis.

## Methods

The project utilized multiple linear regression, with preliminary analysis to check assumptions-- addressing multicollinearity, influential points, heteroscedasticity, normality, and linearity. Different model selection techniques were employed to refine the regression model.
