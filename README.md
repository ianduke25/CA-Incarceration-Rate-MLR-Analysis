# Analysis of Socioeconomic Factors and Incarceration Rates in California

## Project Overview

This project showcases the application of advanced data acquisition techniques, specifically web scraping using Selenium, and sophisticated multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. Focusing on the relationship between socioeconomic factors and incarceration rates in California's communities, it highlights the author's proficiency in both obtaining hard-to-access data and employing statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights.

## Abstract

Leveraging data scraped from the Prison Policy Initiative's website alongside tract-level socioeconomic information from the 2020 United States Census Bureau, this study constructs linear regression models to analyze how various community demographics impact incarceration rates. This dual approach of sophisticated web scraping and statistical analysis serves as a testament to the author's comprehensive skill set in data science.

## Dataset

The incarceration rate data was meticulously extracted from the Prison Policy Initiative's website using Selenium, demonstrating a high level of expertise in web scraping techniques. This data was then merged with socioeconomic variables from the United States Census Bureau, highlighting the author's adeptness in handling and preparing complex datasets for analysis.

## Methods

The project utilized multiple linear regression to explore the influence of socioeconomic factors on incarceration rates, with a strong emphasis on the data acquisition process. Preliminary analyses were conducted to address statistical assumptions, ensuring the robustness of the findings. This methodological rigor underscores the author's competence in both data science and statistical analysis.

## Key Findings

- Demonstrated significant impact of racial and socioeconomic factors on incarceration rates through sophisticated MLR analysis.
- Highlighted the author's ability to employ advanced data acquisition methods, including web scraping with Selenium, to gather essential datasets for the study.
- Unemployment and poverty rates were found to have a positive association with incarceration rates, while higher educational attainment generally correlates with lower incarceration rates.

## Limitations

This study, while comprehensive, acknowledges the limitations of focusing solely on California and the potential biases inherent in the datasets used. The dual focus on web scraping for data acquisition and MLR analysis provides a solid foundation, yet also points to the expansive nature of data science that continuously evolves.

## Conclusion

Through the adept use of Selenium for web scraping and the application of multiple linear regression analysis, this project not only advances our understanding of the factors influencing incarceration rates but also showcases the author's proficiency in both data acquisition and statistical analysis.
